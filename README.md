## üí° Challenges faced and learnings

- I had zero knowledge on Machine Learning Algorithms. Spent major time on learning basic ML concepts and learning how to implement them until I understood how recommender systems work and how to implement them
- I had very basic knowledge about flutter before the program. Spent time on learning application architecture and state management through different methods and also small animations to make the UI better
- I had never implemented any third party services before. Learnt how to use firebase for authentication service
- I had no idea about dex limits on dependencies and therefore could not use cloud firestore service. This resulted in the app on missing out major features
- Deployed a full stack app with frontend, backend and database for the first time. Struggled through it but documentations and tutorials came to the rescue as always. 
- Learnt about AGILE framework of development.
